								<h2>Introduction<br />
								</h2>
								<p>I live and work in Orange County, California and currently work as a Project Manager for a local government agency.  Part of my daily routine is interacting with both residents and local law enforcement.  In those conversations the topic often turns to drugs and their impact on the community.  This visual presentation will use a "martini glass" approach to introduce you to Orange County, local law enforcement and the crime data for one for the largest of the local agencies.  After the introduction there will be a number of charts and dashboards to learn more about crime in the cities.</p>

								<h2>City Police vs. County Sheriff</h2>
							    <p>While working for a consulting company I was assigned to work on a project for the OC Sheriff.  One of the questions I struggled with is what is the difference between a City Chief of Police and a County Sheriff.  To me it seemed like duplication.  The clue is in the name, "City" Chief of Police vs. "County" Sheriff, the Chief of Police patrols and protects a city and is appointed by either the city council or mayor.  The County Sheriff traditionally patrols and protects the unincorporated areas and maintains the County Jail.  Over the years some cities have opted to hire the local Sheriff or contract out to another city for police services.  In my city, Lake Forest, we contract out to the Sheriff.  In this presentation we are going to focus on the cities and unincorporated areas patroled by the Orange County Sheriff.</p>

								<h2>Crime Data from Orange County Sheriff's Department</h2>
								<p>The data was obtained directly from the Orange County Sheriff's Department via a PRA (Public Records Act) request filed in early May 2017. <br /> <br /> The Sheriff's Department, and all California public entities are required to respond to requests for information within certain limits. In selecting the information for this project I requested the following information:</p>
								<li>Date of Incident</li>
								<li>Street Address and City of Incident</li>
								<li>Penal Code and Description</li>
								<li>Case Number</li>

								<h2>Data Normalization and Cleanup</h2>
							<p>OC Sheriff receives about 300,000 calls for service each year.   Each year the definitions can be changed by the State DOJ, resulting in inconsistent data. </p>
							<h3>The following cleanup was performed in order to focus on the presentation of data</h3>
									<li>Municipal Code Violations were removed, e.g. Parking on street cleaning days</li>
									<li>Traffic violations such as speeding and failure to stop for Stop signs</li>
									<li>Calls supporting neighboring cities and jurisdictions</li>
									<li>Crimes where the location could not be determined, identity theft</li>
									<li>Crimes committed in jails or courts</li>
									<li>Every crime was assigned a type category</li>
									<li>Some crimes were grouped for reporting purposes, for example 148a and 148b were both placed under 148</li>
							<br />
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>The data was not in the best shape, it look a lot of work to clean for this presentation.  It was like walking thru a cloud at times, which makes this the perfect picture for data cleanup.</p>
							<p><b>What was reported and what does UCR Mean?</b></p>
									<p>In the case where multiple crimes are charged only the most serious is reported. For example, if someone is arrested for DUI, has drugs and is a felon with a gun, the report only shows “felon with a gun” and the other drug and DUI charges are not displayed. By extension if a person is arrested with multiple drugs, say heroin and pain pills, then only the heroin would be listed. </p>
							<p> This hides the larger number of lower level crimes actually committed.  These are recommended charges based on the time of arrest and can be altered, reduced or dropped by the District Attorney.</p>

								<h2>Overview of crime in the<br />
									Sheriff Area of Patrol</h2>
								<p>I live in Orange County California and have heard some local Deputies comment about the growing problem with crime in Orange County. After the passing of Prop 47 and now legalization of Marijuana, I would have expected a drop in drug arrests and an increase in other crimes as drug addicts used petty crime to fuel their addiction.  The balance of this slide show will show some surprising results based on the information provided. <br /></p>

									<h3>Why this research</h3>
									<p>I live in Orange County California and have heard some local Deputies comment about the growing problem with crime in Orange County. After the passing of Prop 47 and now legalization of Marijuana, I would have expected a drop in drug arrests and an increase in other crimes as drug addicts used petty crime to fuel their addiction.  The balance of this slide show will show some surprising results based on the information provided.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h3>Lake Forest Leads</h3>
									<p>The city I live in, Lake Forest, is surprising in the volume of calls (20% more than the next city) and more than ½ of the calls are drug related. There are more evaluations to do, including a breakdown of what drugs are involved, but the data supplied by the OC Sheriff corresponds with UCR, Universal Crime Reporting by the FBI where only the most serious crime is reported.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>The Challenge</h3>
									<p>Having worked with the Sheriff's Department I've learned a lot of things that the average person hasn't had exposure to in their life.  Terms and phrases are just as bad as the IT world and they have their own language.  I've done my best to translate or explain to the reader, forgive me if I didn't go deep enough. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-headphones">
									<h3>Why the Martini Glass Format </h3>
									<p>I felt it necessary to guide the reader thru the data and explain what they are seeing.  Without some of the definitions, for example UCR, the reader could make assumptions that are not valid.  I truely wish I had more time to explain how the department operates as it is quite fasinating.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>What was I expecting</h3>
									<p>I expected a larger increase in crime as time passed based on some recent laws being changed in California.  It appears that any gains in the reduction of arrests for marajuania are being offset by a large increase in herion and opioid consumption and arrests.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h3>What would I change</h3>
									<p> I would have asked for all charges booked, not just the UCR codes. I also would have asked for a larger block of time. My data is 2015, 2016 and 2017 until May 1, a greater span of time would have  allowed deeper trend analysis and look how Prop 47 impacted these numbers.</p>

								<h2>Scope and definitions</h2>
								<p>Here are some of the details to help understand the charts.  First we start with Contract Cities vs. Unincorporated.  While the Sheriff's primary purpose is to provide law enforcement at the County level, most cities have their own Police Departments.  The OC Sheriff patrols unincorporated areas, which generally large areas of low population.  As the largest LE organization in the County 13 cities have elected to sub contract their police services to the Sheriff.</p>
								<p>The second part of this definitions is to help the reader understand how crimes were grouped.  The number of penal codes makes the roll-up necessary.  There is no standard that I am aware of, so I groups the penal codes according to the type of crime.  Some examples are listed below, a few were hard to classify, is armed car-jacking a crim against a person or a theft/burglary.</p>
